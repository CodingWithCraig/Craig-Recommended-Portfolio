Smooth Animations: Enjoy smooth scrolling, hover effects, and sleek transitions throughout the site, creating an engaging browsing experience.

Updated Projects: The new portfolio showcases my latest projects, including detailed descriptions and tech stacks used. You can see how I approach problem-solving and web development.
